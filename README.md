# Algolab HS2016
In this repository you find my solutions to the problems posed as part of the "AlgoLab" course at ETH Zurich.
(See http://www.cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS16/algolab/index.html)

You can do whatever you want with my solutions except for claiming they are yours.
The code is written by me, I did not come up with all algorithmic ideas..

The test files (including reference outputs) are provided as part of the course. For some problems I added some extra test cases.
